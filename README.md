# Udemy-webpage
ðŸ“š Udemy Clone Website I created a Udemy-inspired website using HTML and CSS. This project is a basic front-end clone that includes a homepage, course sections, and simple navigation, designed to look clean and user-friendly. It was built as part of my practice in web development to improve my skills in HTML structure and CSS styling.
